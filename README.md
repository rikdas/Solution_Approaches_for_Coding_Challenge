# Solution_Approaches_for_Coding_Challenge
# Requirements
Google Colab Notebook 
Python 2.x (Segmentation)
Python 3.x (Sand Elevation) 

#For Sand Elevation 
Run the Sand_Elevation.ipynb in Google Colab
The output (resultant elevation classification images) is stored in OUTPUT folder

#For Road Segmentation
Run the UNet Model SRD Edn - Python 2.ipynb file in Google Colab after uploading the folder structure shared with Google Drive link
To run the code without data augmentation please replace the import_data.py file in google drive folder with the one uploaded in github and please also delete "deleteArgs.py" from he folder
Weight file named "trained_model.h5" is uploaded in google drive since the size is exceeding the capacity allowed for uploading in GitHub
